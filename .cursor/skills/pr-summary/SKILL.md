# PR Summary from Local Changes

Generates a PR description that matches `.github/pull_request_template.md` by analyzing the repository's local changes (staged and/or unstaged).

## Workflow

1. **Gather change context**
   - Run `git status` to see modified/added/deleted files and current branch.
   - Run `git diff --staged` for staged changes; if empty, run `git diff` for unstaged changes (or both if the user wants everything).
   - Optionally run `git log -1 --oneline` or `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` to see recent commits on the branch.

2. **Infer type of change**
   From the diff and file list, choose one or more types that fit:
   - **Enhancement** – improvements to existing behavior
   - **Bug fix** – fixes to incorrect behavior
   - **Security fix** – security-related changes
   - **Breaking change** – API or behavior changes that break compatibility
   - **New feature** – new functionality
   - **New release** – version/release bumps or release notes
   - **Documentation** – docs, comments, README only
   - **Refactor** – restructuring without changing behavior

3. **Write the summary as topic bullets**
   - Use only bullet points (topics), no paragraph text.
   - One short line per change, e.g. "add ...", "fix ...", "update ...", "remove ...".
   - No extra explanation; keep each line concise.

4. **Output in template format**
   Use this structure (from the project template). Replace the summary text and check the applicable type(s).

5. **Deliver the result**
   - Reply with the PR summary in a **markdown code block** (so the user can copy it from the chat).
   - **Also write** the same content to `pr-description.md` in the repository root so the user can open the file and copy from there. Tell the user the file path; they can delete the file after pasting into the PR.

## Output Template

Use this exact structure. Under "Summary", list only bullet-point topics (no paragraph). In "Type of Change", check only the box(es) that apply (use `[x]` for checked, `[ ]` for unchecked).

```markdown
## ✨ Summary

- <topic 1>
- <topic 2>
- ...

## 🔧 Type of Change

- [ ] ✨ Enhancement
- [ ] 🐞 Bug fix
- [ ] 🔐 Security fix
- [ ] 💥 Breaking change
- [ ] 🚀 New feature
- [ ] 📦 New release
- [ ] 📚 Documentation
- [ ] ♻️ Refactor
```

## Example

**After reviewing a diff that adds a new Swift API and updates README:**

```markdown
## ✨ Summary

- add public `validate(input:)` method
- update README with usage docs

## 🔧 Type of Change

- [ ] ✨ Enhancement
- [ ] 🐞 Bug fix
- [ ] 🔐 Security fix
- [ ] 💥 Breaking change
- [x] 🚀 New feature
- [ ] 📦 New release
- [x] 📚 Documentation
- [ ] ♻️ Refactor
```

## Notes

- If there are no local changes, say so and suggest running from a branch with changes or staging files first.
- Prefer the project template at `.github/pull_request_template.md` if it diverges from the template above; the template in this skill matches the current project standard.
